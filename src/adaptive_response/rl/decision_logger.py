# and later benchmark comparison, requested alongside the aggregate CSVs
# already produced by train_gnn_policy.py. This is opt-in (see run_episode's
# `decision_logger` parameter): normal training is entirely unaffected unless
# a caller explicitly attaches one, so this cannot change any existing run's
# behavior, timing, or output.
