# Rehearsal Decision Log

This file mirrors project-relevant decisions made after Project Freeze 3.0 for the rehearsal repository. The canonical project Decision Log remains the governing source of truth.

## 2026-09-10 — M0 interface indexing review

**Status:** APPROVED by team.

**Decision:** Extend `GraphState` with explicit tensor/index mappings required for all planners and GNN message passing:

- add `node_ids`, index-aligned with `node_features` and `feasibility_mask`;
- add `edge_index`, edge-aligned with `edge_features`;
- make `q_by_site` available through the shared planner `constraints` / context so the Information Gain planner can evaluate the observation model without adding `q_i` to learned node features by default.

**Reason:** Demu's interface review identified two structural blockers: planner outputs could not map tensor rows back to real `site_id`s, and a GNN could not perform message passing from edge attributes without graph connectivity indices. The Information Gain baseline also requires explicit detectability for prospective likelihood calculations.

**Impact:** No change to the frozen evidence semantics, feature list, hidden-truth boundary, planner ladder, or product architecture. This makes the existing interface executable rather than redefining it.

**Owner:** Team.

## 2026-09-10 — M2 belief-engine implementation defaults

**Status:** CURRENT DEFAULT for rehearsal implementation; not an ecological fact and not a new frozen project decision.

**Decision:**

- Priors are supplied explicitly to `BeliefEngine`; the engine does not invent occupancy priors from habitat, distance, or the synthetic hidden world.
- A confirmed initial detection may be initialized at occupancy belief 1 under the MVP no-false-positive assumption.
- Site-level evidence updates use the explicit effort-aware binary observation model from the Technical Specification.
- Belief uncertainty is represented for v0 as Bernoulli entropy in bits, with range `[0, 1]`.
- The first belief engine is site-local; it does not propagate a positive detection to connected nodes unless a later explicit spatial/world model is introduced.

**Reason:** Project Freeze 3.0 freezes explicit effort/q Bayesian evidence semantics but does not freeze the numerical prior scheme or exact uncertainty scalar. Keeping priors caller-supplied prevents a design choice from being presented as ecological knowledge. Bernoulli entropy is simple, inspectable, and directly useful to the later Information Gain baseline.

**Impact:** M2 can be tested without coupling inference to the toy simulator. Spatial belief coupling, real-data-informed priors, and q range calibration remain later validation/modeling work.

**Owner:** Pablo + Fede, with cross-team review if these choices change `GraphState` semantics.
